# How to make it easy for your software to get cited?

## 1. Create a DOI for your software if there isn't a software paper

* [Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) will mint a new DOI for every release on GitHub.
* Or you can upload to [Figshare](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) to get a DOI.

## 2. Alert users to your citation with a file named [CITATION]

* Include your DOI, a suggested citation, and raw BibTeX
* Check out the [example](citation-examples.md)

## 3. Remind users to cite you when they run your software.
